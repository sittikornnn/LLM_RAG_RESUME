## ABOUT ME

As a recent Artificial Intelligence graduate, I am passionate about developing AI models and leveraging data to solve real-world  problems.  My  project  experience  includes  practical  applications  like  an  exam  test  for  pharmacists  and computer  vision  solutions  for  safety  compliance,  such  as  detecting  helmet  usage.  I  thrive  in  collaborative  team environments, enjoying theoretical discussions on optimizing algorithm selection for practical implementation.
